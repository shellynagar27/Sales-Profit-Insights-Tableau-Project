## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware (Imaginary Company), a computer hardware and peripherals company with branches across India, is struggling with declining sales. The sales director faces challenges in understanding the business's performance, as regional managers often sugarcoat issues and flood him with Excel files instead of providing clear insights. This reliance on cumbersome spreadsheets has led to increasing frustration, as it's difficult to digest the data effectively.
## Solution
The sales director of AtliQ Hardware decided to build a Power BI dashboard to transform data into visual insights for better decision-making. To accomplish this, he hired a team of data professionals.
## Steps Taken
Conducted data analysis using SQL to gain deeper insights into the dataset.
Connected MySQL Server as the data source to Tableau for visualization.
Performed ETL processes for data cleaning and normalization.
Created necessary measures to build visuals and dashboards.
Incorporated feedback from stakeholders to refine and enhance the final report.
## Final Result
A dashboard displaying AtliQ Hardware's sales trends over the last 4 years, with the potential to boost revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.
