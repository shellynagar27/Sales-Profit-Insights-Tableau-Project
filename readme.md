## Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a computer hardware and peripherals company with branches across India, was experiencing declining sales. The sales director struggled with analyzing business performance due to an overload of raw Excel data from regional managers. This project aims to solve this issue by creating a dynamic and interactive dashboard to provide clear, actionable insights into sales trends and profitability using **SQL**, **MySQL**, and **Tableau**.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware's sales team relied on cumbersome spreadsheets, making it difficult for the sales director to:
- Gain visibility into sales and profitability trends.
- Identify underperforming regions, products, and customers.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve sales and profitability.

## Solution
To address these challenges, a comprehensive dashboard was built to:
- Visualize key sales metrics and profit trends over the past **4 years**.
- Provide insights into top customers, products, and underperforming regions.
- Support better decision-making by highlighting revenue growth opportunities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the data.
- **MySQL**: Used as the primary data source for structured storage and management.
- **Tableau**: For building interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
- **ETL Processes**: Implemented for data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.

## Key Features
- **Sales Insights**: Visualized **revenue and sales trends** by year, top 5 customers and products, and **revenue distribution** by Indian cities. ![Screenshot 2024-10-12 225301](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1701709f-a411-4e3c-8dbf-81782910bd68)
- **Profit Insights**: Showcased **profit trends by quarter**, **revenue vs. profit** by city, and **profit margins** with insights into both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar sales channels.![Screenshot 2024-10-12 225316](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb5de6a-9ae3-4583-b645-dc6ea6ddd61f)
- **Customer Performance Matrix**: Provided a detailed view of **customer profitability**, including **revenue**, **profit**, and **profit margin %**.

## Project Highlights
- **4 Years of Sales Data**: Analyzed and visualized **4 years of historical sales and profit data**.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Replaced manual Excel-based reporting with automated insights, enabling a projected **7% revenue increase** in the next quarter.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Dynamic and interactive dashboards that make it easy to filter and drill down into regional and product-specific performance.

## How to Use
1. **Data Source**: The dataset is stored in **MySQL**, structured with tables for transactions, customers, date, markets, products and customers with over 1lakh+ records.
2. **Tableau**: Import the data from MySQL into Tableau for visualization. The dashboard is fully interactive and allows users to filter data by year, region, and product.
3. **Insights**: Use the dashboard to explore trends, identify top-performing regions/products, and gain insights into customer behavior and profitability.
